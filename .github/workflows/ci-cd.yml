  # JOB 1: Test - Runs on every push and PR
  test:
    name: Run Tests and Build
    # This job can run on Linux, macOS, or Windows
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [22.x] # Test against multiple Node.js versions

    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}

        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      # 3. Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 4. Run linting (optional - add a lint script to package.json first)
      # - name: Run Linter
      #   run: npm run lint

      # 5. Run tests
      #- name: Run Tests
      #  run: npm test -- --watch=false --silent
      # The flags prevent interactive mode and reduce output noise.

      # 6. Build the project for production

      # 7. (Optional) Upload the production build as an artifact
      # Useful for debugging the build step

  # JOB 2: Deploy - Only runs on push to the main branch after test succeeds
